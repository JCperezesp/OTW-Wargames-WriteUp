# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è OverTheWire WarGames WriteUp

Welcome to my repository containing the walkthrough for various of the [OverTheWire wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). In this repository, I document the steps I followed to solve each level, along with some detailed explanations and solutions.

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal record of my journey through the Bandit challenges on OverTheWire. It includes:

- **Level-by-level write-ups:** Detailed descriptions of the approach used to overcome each challenge.
- **Command explanations:** Clear and concise breakdowns of the commands and techniques used.
- **Tips & tricks:** Useful hints for common pitfalls and key insights that helped me solve the puzzles.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate the levels:** Start with the Bandit0 write-up and work your way through each level. Each file provides the challenge description, the commands used, and the solution.
2. **Review command explanations:** If you‚Äôre new to Linux or specific commands (e.g., `grep`, `tr`, `ssh`), refer to the detailed command breakdowns in each level‚Äôs documentation.
3. **Experiment:** The repository is designed to be a learning resource. Feel free to modify the commands, run them on your own system, and explore alternative solutions.
