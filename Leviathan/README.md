# üêâ Leviathan WarGame

## About the Challenge

Leviathan is an intermediate-level wargame hosted by OverTheWire that focuses on binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and low-level system security. Unlike Bandit, which primarily teaches command-line skills, Leviathan challenges players to analyze and exploit binary programs to find passwords and advance through levels.

## WriteUp Contents

This directory is prepared to contain writeups for the Leviathan challenges. The writeups will cover:

- Binary analysis techniques
- Reverse engineering methods
- Buffer overflow exploits
- Assembly language basics
- GDB debugging techniques
- Memory corruption vulnerabilities
- System call analysis

Each writeup will include:
- Challenge analysis
- Binary examination steps
- Exploitation techniques
- Code snippets and assembly analysis
- Debugging sessions with GDB

## How to Start

To begin the Leviathan challenge from level 0, connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh -p 2223 leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org
```

**Password for level 0**: `leviathan0`

Once connected, you'll find yourself in the `/home/leviathan0` directory. Look for executable files or hidden directories that might contain clues to the next level's password.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting Leviathan, it's recommended to have:
- Completed the Bandit wargame
- Basic understanding of C programming
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of assembly language (helpful but not required)
